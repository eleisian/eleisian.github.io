the world is hungry for new ideas.
those who can create new ideas will be the ones who can create new worlds.
those who can't create new ideas will feed off of the ideas of others.
it seems like everyone nowadays is just trying to break down the weak.
the world needs new ideas.
the world needs new worlds.
the world needs new people.
