I'm building an anonymous text board for dealing with your feelings.

The idea is that you can post your feelings and get feedback with others.

I'm calling it situationships.online

I'm a pretty sensitive person and I've been hurt a lot in the past.

I created an offline sentiment analysis tool to help categorize your feelings and match how you're feeling with others who are feeling the same way.

All posts are anonymous. But you can write a name if you want to.

You can also see how others are feeling and respond to them.
