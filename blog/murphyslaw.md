If you fear the worst, the worst will happen.

Let it end. Allow it to escape from your grasp. If it is meant to be yours, it will find its way back to you. Choose peace. Give yourself permission to breathe a little easier in its absence. Resist the urge to try to control the outcome. All we can do is do our best.
