            <p>In other words instead of actually cultivating talent large companies like Microsoft somehow end up with DEI recruiters that only hire within their cultural bounds.</p>
            <p>A.K.A circlejerk companies are complacent because concave smooth brain hiring managers cannot recognize talent.</p>
            <p>Solution? Demand free labor from artists while maintaining superiority complex.</p>

            <p>Some software engineers have some serious ego issues. This is why A.I. art is so lifeless.</p>
            <p>We are all headed towards the same place anyways. Just because you have a 'fake email job' means you have a cushier ride to the end.</p>
            <p>Respect everyone equally.</p>
            <p><strong>04/02/24</strong></p>
            <p>No if ands or buts. Yes this is truly an ultimatum and certainly does not inspire dreams.</p>
            <p>Here is my next 3 months plan:</p>
            <p>1. I will create a MDX or markdown version of this blog.</p>
            <p>2. I will master my craft of digital music [it is interesting that all radio signals from inception are projected out into the universe].</p>
            <p>3. I will complete my tasks of becoming a technical artist [this entails creating 3D scenes with professional lighting and rendering].</p>
            <p>4. I will create more apps such as a Hirigana and Katakana practice flash card app as well as mouse writing app.</p>
            <p>5. I will participate in Google's A.I. hackathon on Devpost.</p>
            <p>6. I will pass my Python and Computer Forensics course with A+.</p>

            <p>I have fully decided that I will learn Japanese.</p>
            <p>I truly believe that Japanese and Korean are shifted audio frames of Chinese.</p>
            <p>I am Chinese and I believe that we are all papers cut from the same tree.</p>
            <p>After learning Japanese I will learn Russian and Korean.</p>
            <p>There is a theory that language is a barrier preventing humanity from becoming a Type I civalization.</p>
            <p>I think where I belong is at an interesction of music, mathematics, philosophy, behavioral psychology, and communication.</p>
            <p>I will dedicate the rest of my life to developing a form of communication amongst all living beings.</p>
            <p>I truly believe that most humans have lost connection with nature and have forgotten how to communicate not only 
            with each other but with animals as well. It is usually around this time that society collapses. 
            </p>
            <p>I believe we are nearing end times of this era. There will be collapse, there will be difficulty.
            Most people will believe that I am crazy. The dunces will form their confederacy but there is no halting the future.
            Most third world countries do not face mental health challenges. America is doomed. Americans take pride in being deviants. 
            Why not just let someone enjoy something? That seems to be the main arguement of those who have strayed from the path. Which path you ask?
            The path of humanity. Not some deranged version created by some sick person. You might argue that that is human as well. 
            Then humanity is sickness and we should seek health.
            </p>
            <p>It is truly unfortunate that we bar those from seeking health.</p>

            <p><strong>03/09/24</strong></p>
            <p>Recently, I have been working on level design with Unreal Engine.</p>
            <p>I think it is pretty amazing what the team at Epic is doing specifically with nanites and scene realism.
            I was particularly inspired these past weeks to create a scene with Unreal to showcase my level design ability.
            But mostly because I really want to be able to create inspiring works of art with 3D to go along with my music.
            It is unfortunate that Unreal has sunsetted the ability to build HTML5 projects otherwise I would have uploaded my scene to my website.
            However, I am still figuring out a workaround.</p>
            <p>It seems like nowadays cool features are placed behind paywalls or left open to third party organizations to profit off. 
            I miss the days of the internet when groups of people would build amazing things for others to enjoy.</p>
            <p>Anyways, if you are reading this please enjoy some level design that I created with Unreal Engine.</p>

                     This project is a proof of concept for creating 3D scenes with the react-three-fiber library. FBX objects were imported and textures were applied. These loading screens were created with Blender and Adobe After Effects.  
                     Theoretically these loading screens can be linked with a scripting language to be placed within a website or video game.

                       This project was built upon an existing project that I found on <a href="https://codesandbox.io"><code>Codesandbox.io</code></a> Someone had already created an
                       Ascii-renderer for 3D objects with react-three-fiber. However they did not add a function so that you can import your own GLTF 
                       objects to the scene. I just created a function to do so. <a href="https://eleisian.github.io/ascii-renderer" target="_blank"><code>https://eleisian.github.io/ascii-renderer</code></a>
